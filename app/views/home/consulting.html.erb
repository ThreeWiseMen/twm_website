    <h1>Consulting</h1>
    <p>
      The key to our consulting success is our people. We don't get lost in lofty pie-in-the-sky,
      rediculous architecture diagrams, reams of UML, big slushy processes. We focus on the
      simplest, pragmatic solution to each problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our people are <em>involved</em>. In your project, in the global open-source communities in which they
      specialize, in life. You can't find new and innovative solutions to anything living in a bubble.
      <strong>Why wait to get the ball rolling? Call us today.</strong>

        <h2>Perfomance Analysis and Tuning</h2>
        <p>
          Do you have a web application or system that isn't performing the way you'd like or need? You've
          tried what you thought were obvious optimizations but can't seem to find what's causing it?
        </p>
        <p>
          We've taken 60 second page load times and turned them into 3 second load times, sometimes without
          even touching the application code.

        <h2>Integration of Disparate Systems</h2>
        <p>
          We've tied so many different kinds of systems together we've lost count. If you find yourself
          relying on people manually moving data around between mainframes and spreadsheets, or spending
          time on multiple data-entry, you likely have an integration problem.
