    <h2>Budgeting for Your Project</h2>
    <p>
      Our development teams work in <em>sprints</em>, which wraps up planning, development,
      testing, and packaging in a short one or two week interval. This provides predictable
      costs, regular releases, and regular incremental improvement of your application.
      <em>Call us today for pricing!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Projects are estimated in the number of sprints they may take to complete allowing you to work to
      a target budget without overruns. Our agile processes ensure that your most critical features
      are built first and for the money you spend, you are getting the best possible software for your
      business.
    </p>
    <h3>Software Development Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Capture and document the overall reasoning behind why you are building your application. It
      helps keep you and the team focused on your <em>business goals</em> rather than getting lost in
      the technology or implementation of the moment. This is very highly recommended if your project
      is estimated to require more than 2-3 iterations.
    </p>
    <h3>Express Development Sprint</h3>
    <p>
      A single resource from a stable team allocated for a one-week period. More than one developer may be involved
      on different days, depending on specific technical requirements at certain times. However
      your assigned team will generally be the same people for the duration of your project. Excellent
      for small to mid-size projects budgeting $5K or more.
    </p>
    <h3>Enterprise Development Sprint</h3>
    <p>
      Three stable resources allocated for a two-week period. Your assigned team will generally be with you
      for the entire duration of your project. Excellent for larger scale projects
      budgeting $100K or more.
